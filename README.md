**## git fetch**

> Run this from within the directory that contains your local repository. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.

> This is a command that you can make via the command prompt in a command window. To use it you need to install a git CLI (Command Line Interface) - which lets you issue manual git commands.
